	<ul>
		<li> <b><font color="magenta">Display Name:</font></b> When a user visits your web application for the first time, they should be prompted to type in a display 
				name that will eventually be associated with every message the user sends. If a user closes the page and returns to your app later, 
				the display name should still be remembered.
		<li> <b><font color="magenta">Channel Creation:</font></b> Any user should be able to create a new channel, so long as its name doesnâ€™t conflict with the name 
				of an existing channel.
		<li> <b><font color="magenta">Channel List:</font></b> Users should be able to see a list of all current channels, and selecting one should allow the user to view the channel. 
		<li> <b><font color="magenta">Messages View:</font></b> Once a channel is selected, the user should see any messages that have already been sent in that channel, up to a 
				maximum of 100 messages.
		<li> <b><font color="magenta">Sending Messages:</font></b> Once in a channel, users should be able to send text messages to others the channel. When a user sends a message, 
				their display name and the timestamp of the message should be associated with the message. All users in the channel should then see the new message 
				(with display name and timestamp) appear on their channel page. Sending and receiving messages should NOT require reloading the page.
		<li> <b><font color="magenta">Remembering the Channel:</font></b> If a user is on a channel page, closes the web browser window, and goes back to your web application, your application 
				should remember what channel the user was on previously and take the user back to that channel.
