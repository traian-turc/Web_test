Casting

<BODY bgcolor=white>

In C/C++, casting serves several different purposes.  The designers
of C++  realized that and decided that there should be four kinds
of cast operators.
<P>
 <UL>
   <LI> <B>static cast</B>
<P>
   Conventional casting of one type to another, where there is some
meaning to what the cast will do.  (Thus, normally you can't cast
from a <B>Foo</B> to a <B>Bar</B>, unless there's a definition for
how to do this).
<P>
   <LI> <B>dynamic cast</B>
<P>
   Meant for downcasting from a base class to a derived class.  This
check is done at runtime (as opposed to static casting which can
generate the necessary code to do the casting at compile time).
<P>
   <LI> <B>const cast</B>
<P>
   To temporarily remove constness from a const variable.  Mostly used
to get rid of warnings about violating constness.
<P>
   <LI> <B>reinterpret cast</B>
<P>
   To allow you to cast one pointer type to another pointer type
to another.
</UL>
<P>   
   We're only interested in <B>static_cast</B> and <B>reinterpret_cast</B>.
<H3>
More about <tt>static_cast</tt>
</H3>
   The main kind of static casting we're interested in falls into
two categories:
<P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI> Casting from one primitive type to another (e.g., <B>char</B>
to <B>int</B>, <B>float</B> to <B>int</B>).

   <LI> Casting from a shorter type to a longer type or vice versa
 (e.g., <B>short</B> to <B>int</B>, <B>long</B> to <B>int</B>).
</UL>
<P>
   Casting from one type to another is interesting, particularly,
casting <B>float</B> to <B>int</B>.  Like the unary minus, the
casting operation does NOT change the value of the variable it is
casting.  Instead, like unary minus, it creates a temporary value
which is the casted result.
<P>
   For example, consider
<FONT size=+2>
<PRE>
  float f = 3.0 ;
  int val = static_cast&lt;int&gt;( f ) ;
</PRE>
</FONT>
   The static cast of <B>f</B> to an int does not change the value
of <B>f</B>.  Instead, it creates a temporary <B>int</B>.
<P>
   Casting <B>float</B> to <B>int</B> causes bits to change (from the
original value to the temporary casted value). Recall that <B>float</B>
are represented in IEEE 754 single precision while <B>int</B> is
2C.  Those are different representations.
<P>
   The semantics of casting <B>float</B> to <B>int</B> causes the
value to get truncated (thus, 3.9 is truncated to 3.0), but it also
changes representation.   
<P>
   The semantics of casting <B>int</B> to <B>value</B> causes the
value to convert to float (thus, 3 is converted to 3.0), which also
changes representation.
<P>
   We look at this kind of casting, precisely because it makes
you think about the internal data representation.  3 and 3.0 look
very close when you write it in a program.  However, internally,
(once stored in a running program) they're represented quite
differently.
<H4>
Casting different sizes
</H4>
   Sometimes you need to cast from a shorter type to a longer type
or vice versa.  For example, you may need to cast from <B>short int</B>
to an <B>int</B>.  These <I>may</I> be the same sizes, depending on the
compiler, but for now, let's assume they are different sizes.
<P>
   If you go from a smaller size to a larger size, at least for an
<B>int</B>, it sign extends.  It zero-extends if it's an <B>unsigned
int</B>.  This preserves the value as you increase the number of
bytes.
<P>
   If you go from a larger size to a smaller size (in both <B>int</B>
and <B>unsigned int</B>) it chops off the uppermost bytes.  This can
cause the number to change values (since those uppermost bytes might
be useful for the value).
<P>
   Even though the representation isn't as dramatic as <B>float</B>
to <B>int</B>, it still occurs.
<H3>
More about <tt>reinterpret_cast</tt>
</H3>
   In C, it turns out to be useful to convert from one pointer
type to another, especially if you're working on systems programming
(operating systems, for example).
<P>
   Since all pointers are addresses, and all addresses have the same
number of bytes (at least, on a given ISA), the casting does not
convert any bits.
<P>
   C++ decided to call this pointer-to-pointer casting,
<B>reinterpret_cast</B>.  What's being reinterpreted is
the meaning of the bytes.
<P>
   Let's look at an example:
<FONT size=+2>
<PRE>
   Foo * fooPtr = new Foo( 2, 3 ) ;  // create a Foo pointer
   Bar * barPtr = reinterpret_cast&lt;Bar *&gt;( fooPtr ) ;
</PRE>
</FONT>
   We had a <B>Foo *</B> pointer, which is some address in memory,
that stores some number of bytes of a <B>Foo</B> object.
<P>
   When reinterpeting that pointer to a <B>Bar *</B> pointer, those
bytes of the <B>Foo</B> object are <I>unchanged</I>.
<P>
   If you dereference <B>barPtr</B>, the runtime system will consider
the bytes stored at the addreess of <B>barPtr</B> (which is the same
as the address of <B>fooPtr</B>) to be a <B>Bar</B> object.
<P>
   If you're thinking "there's no way that those bytes, which are
currently meaningful for a <B>Foo</B> object, could also be meaningful
for a <B>Bar</B> object", then you're right.   More likely than not,
<B>barPtr</B> points to a <B>Bar</B> object with garbage bytes.
<P>
   Worse, if <B>Bar</B> is sufficiently larger than <B>Foo</B>, then
you might cause a core dump when accessing data members of <B>Bar</B>
(because they may fall outside the valid rance of memory used for
the <B>Foo</B> object).
<P>
   You may think that it's completely useless to reinterpret cast.
For the most part, it is useless.   However, the most common use
of reinterpret cast is to look at the individual bytes of some
structure.
<P>
   For example, suppose you're interested in finding out what
the individual bytes of a <B>long int</B> look like (you can
pick any type instead of <B>long int</B>).
<P>
<FONT size=+1>
<PRE>
   long val = 0x01234567cafebabe ;
   char * charPtr = reinterpret_cast&lt;char *&gt;( &amp; val ) ;
   for ( int i = 0 ; i < sizeof( long ) ; i++ )
     {
       cout &lt;&lt; byteToHex( *charPtr ) &lt;&lt; endl ;
       charPtr ++ ;
     }
</PRE>
</FONT>
   This puts a pointer at the beginning of <B>val</B> and prints out
the bytes of <B>val</B> in hex format (assume <B>byteToHex()</B>
returns a string that represents the hex value of the <B>char</B>
passed as argument).
<P>
   Why would you do this?  Functions like <B>read()</B> and
<B>write()</B> (which are part of the <B>istream</B> and
<B>ostream</B> methods), often take a <B>char *</B> pointer, which is
used as an address of any object/data type, and the prints out or
reads in the contents of some object byte by byte.  Again, it's useful
to think of <B>char</B> as a byte type, in this case, instead of
thinking of it as a character, just like it's useful to think
of <B>char *</B> as an address in memory of some object, rather
than an address of a character.
<P>
   Accessing the individual bytes can be useful when sending
structures across a network, or when saving a structure to a file.
<P>
   The only problem with this sending objects or structures in this is
potential incompatibility with the host machine (which sends the data)
and the remote machine (which receives the data).  If you send out an
arbitrary object byte-by-byte over the network, the remote machine
that receives this data must represent the object in exactly the same
way that the host machine represents it (the same endianness, same
order of data members, etc).
<P>
   If the remote machine has a different representation, it may be
worth encoding the structure of the object using some convention both
sides agree on (say, XML).  This will, more than likely, take more
space and more processing, but should be more compatible for a wider
variety of machines.  In any case, coming up with a representation
makes you think of a representation rather than assuming any object
sent over the network will automatically be put together properly on
the other end.
<P>
   Another reason for using reinterpret cast is to allow you to edit
individual bytes in memory by using bitwise/bitshift operators.  This
may seem like a very odd reason, but if you're writing linkers or
loaders, it may be necessary to edit the instructions (this is called
<B>binary rewriting</B>) as you link or load.

<H4>
Converting float to int while preserving bits
</H4>
   Casting from <B>float</B> to <B>int</B> or vice-versa causes
the representation of the casted result to change from the original
representation.
<P>
    Suppose a <B>float</B> and <B>int</B> both have 4 bytes.
You've written a number in <B>float</B> but want to know its
corresponding <B>int</B> value.   That is, in both cases, the bits
are exactly the same, but it has one meaning, if you think of those
bits as a <B>float</B> and another meaning if you think of those
bits as an <B>int</B>.
<P>
     How do you convert between the two types without changing the
bits (which occurs when you static cast)?   The answer?  Reinterpret
cast.  Of course, reinterpret cast works with pointers, so we'll
need pointers.
<P>
   The code is amazingly short:
<FONT size=+1>
<PRE>
   float val = 3.0 ;
   int num = * reinterpret_cast&lt;int *&gt;( &amp; val ) ;
</PRE>
</FONT>
   In this code, we create a pointer to <B>val</B> using the 
&amp; operator.   This is reinterpreted as a <B>int *</B> pointer.
Recall that reinterpreting pointers does not change the bytes in
memory.
<P>
   Then, you dereference it to get the <B>int</B>.
<P>
  Of course, this code assumes that <B>float</B> and <B>int</B> have
the same number of bytes.  On most machines/compilers, this is true,
but it's possible that the sizes may be different.  Languages like
Java avoid this problem by mandating the sizes of various types.
Languages like C/C++ leave the number of bytes of each type up to the
compiler writer.   The assumption is, for C/C++, that the compiler
writer will pick the size that's the most "natural" for the CPU
it runs on (thus, on old PCs, <B>int</B> was 2 bytes, and on recent
PCs, they are 4 bytes).
<H3>
Summary
</H3>
   The reason we look at static casting is to note that casting often
causes a change of representation.  Either the representation can
completely change (say, from 2C to IEEE 754), or it changes in the
number of bytes (say, from int to long).   The bits change when
casting is performed.
<P>
   On the other hand, when you reinterpret cast (which is casting from
one pointer type to another) the bits do not change.  That's because
all pointers on a given machine have the same number of bytes (usually
4 or 8 bytes for a 32 bit and 64 bit machine, respectively).  Reinterpret
casting preserves the address.
<P>
   The difference is when you dereference the pointer.   Suppose the
new pointer type requires N bytes of memory.   The runtime system
will use the N bytes at the address, and consider those bytes as the
object.  Usually, this will cause you to have a nonsense object.
<P>
   Thus, the most common use of reinterpret casting is to cast
to a <B>char *</B> where you can then look at the individual bytes
of an object (since <B>char</B> holds one byte), possibly so you
can save it to a file or send the bytes over a network.  Occasionally,
you can edit bytes by casting to a <B>char *</B> (and dereferencing).
